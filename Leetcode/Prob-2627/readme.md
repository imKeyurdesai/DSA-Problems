# 2627. Debounce

**Difficulty:** Medium  

## Problem Description

Given a function `fn` and a time in milliseconds `t`, return a debounced version of that function.

A **debounced function** is a function whose execution is delayed by `t` milliseconds and whose execution is cancelled if it is called again within that window of time. The debounced function should also receive the passed parameters.

### Example Timeline

For example, let's say `t = 50ms`, and the function was called at 30ms, 60ms, and 100ms:

- The first 2 function calls would be cancelled
- The 3rd function call would be executed at 150ms

If instead `t = 35ms`:

- The 1st call would be cancelled
- The 2nd would be executed at 95ms
- The 3rd would be executed at 135ms

### Debounce Schematic

Each rectangle represents 100ms and the debounce time is 400ms. Each color represents a different set of inputs.

### Constraints

- Do not use lodash's `_.debounce()` function

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
t = 50
calls = [
  {"t": 50, inputs: [1]},
  {"t": 75, inputs: [2]}
]
```

**Output:**

```
[{"t": 125, inputs: [2]}]
```

**Explanation:**

```javascript
let start = Date.now();
function log(...inputs) {
  console.log([Date.now() - start, inputs]);
}
const dlog = debounce(log, 50);
setTimeout(() => dlog(1), 50);
setTimeout(() => dlog(2), 75);
```

The 1st call is cancelled by the 2nd call because the 2nd call occurred before 100ms. The 2nd call is delayed by 50ms and executed at 125ms with inputs `(2)`.

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
t = 20
calls = [
  {"t": 50, inputs: [1]},
  {"t": 100, inputs: [2]}
]
```

**Output:**

```
[{"t": 70, inputs: [1]}, {"t": 120, inputs: [2]}]
```

**Explanation:**

- The 1st call is delayed until 70ms with inputs `(1)`
- The 2nd call is delayed until 120ms with inputs `(2)`

### Example 3

**Input:**

```
t = 150
calls = [
  {"t": 50, inputs: [1, 2]},
  {"t": 300, inputs: [3, 4]},
  {"t": 300, inputs: [5, 6]}
]
```

**Output:**

```
[{"t": 200, inputs: [1,2]}, {"t": 450, inputs: [5, 6]}]
```

**Explanation:**

- The 1st call is delayed by 150ms and ran at 200ms with inputs `(1, 2)`
- The 2nd call is cancelled by the 3rd call
- The 3rd call is delayed by 150ms and ran at 450ms with inputs `(5, 6)`

## Constraints

- `0 <= t <= 1000`
- `1 <= calls.length <= 10`
- `0 <= calls[i].t <= 1000`
- `0 <= calls[i].inputs.length <= 10`
